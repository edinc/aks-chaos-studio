# Chaos Experiment One

In this experiment we going to cause some of the pods to fail on the AKS cluster. We can then use our Azure Load Testing service to then run load tests:

1. before the experiment starts - to get a baseline
2. during the middle of a load test - to see how the experiment impacts a busy service
3. for the full duration of a load test - to get a better feel of the overall loss in performance

## Set up the Chaos Experiment

## Set up the Load Test 

## Perform test runs

### Run one - before the chaos experiment starts


### Run two - during a load test


### Run three - for the full duration of a load test


## Observations and Conclusions
